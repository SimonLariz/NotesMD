## Week 4

Geochronology - the science of determining the age of rocks, fossils, and sediments

Relative Dating - determining the age of a fossil by comparing its placement with that of fossils in other layers of rock

Absolute Dating - determining the age of a fossil by using radiometric dating to measure the decay of isotopes

Jame Ussher - used the Bible to calculate the age of the Earth to be 6000 years old, he was refuted by theory of uniformitarianism and the discovery of deep time

Lyell - proposed the theory of uniformitarianism, which states that the geologic processes that shape Earth are uniform through time

Lord Kelvin - used the rate of cooling of the Earth to calculate the age of the Earth to be 20-40 million years old, he was refuted by the discovery of radioactivity

Eons - the largest division of geologic time

All elements with atomic numbers greater than 83 are radioactive

Alpha Decay - the release of an alpha particle (2 protons and 2 neutrons) from the nucleus of an atom
Atomic number decreases by 2, atomic mass decreases by 4

Beta (minus) decay - the release of a beta particle (an electron) from the nucleus of an atom
Atomic number increases by 1, atomic mass stays the same

Beta (plus) decay - the release of a positron (a positive electron) from the nucleus of an atom, also called positron emission

Gamma decay - the release of a gamma ray (a photon) from the nucleus of an atom

Potassium-40 decays into Calcium-40 through beta decay, weight stays the same but atomic number increases by 1 since a neutron turns into a proton

Carbon 14 is created in the atmosphere when nitrogen 14 is hit by a neutron, it decays into nitrogen 14 through beta decay
The half life of carbon 14 is 5730 years

Mass Spectrometry - a technique that separates particles according to their mass
Usually performed with an ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer)
