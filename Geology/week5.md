## Week 5

The Big Bang - the beginning of the universe, 13.77 billion years ago

At the beginning only had two basic elements, hydrogen and helium
Universe is 93% hydrogen and 7% helium

Hydrogen and Helium form interstellar clouds called nebulae

Once a nebule gets very large, it gets hot enough for H and He to fuse into heavier elements (H to He to C to O to Fe)

Star - balance between gravity pulling in and fusion pushing out

Stellar nucleosynthesis - the process of creating heavier elements in stars through fusion until iron is reached

* Watch video on slides

Supernova - the explosion of a star, occurs when the star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravity

Supernovae create all elements heavier than iron, the explosion is so powerful that it creates elements heavier than iron

# Origins of the Elements
1. Big Bang - H and He
2. Stellar Nucleosynthesis - up to Fe
3. Supernovae - heavier than Fe

# Formation of the Solar System
1. Nebula - a cloud of gas and dust
2. Nebula collapses under its own gravity
3. Nebula flattens into a disk, the center is the sun and the disk is the planets (protoplanetary disk)
4. Sun forms in the center
5. Planets form in the disk

The 4 inner planets are rocky, the 4 outer planets are gaseous

Rocky planets are made of silicates and metals, gaseous planets are made of hydrogen and helium

Rocky planets exist due to solar wind, which blows away hydrogen and helium (lighter elements)

Astroid - a small rocky body orbiting the sun
Astroid belt - a region of space between Mars and Jupiter where most astroids are found

Protoplanets - are asteroids that have differentiated layers (Vesta)

Dwarf planet - proplanets that have a spherical shape but have not cleared their orbit of other objects (Pluto, Ceres)

Planet - protoplanets that have a spherical shape and have cleared their orbit of other objects (Earth, Mars, Venus, Mercury)

# Asteroid vs Meteoroid vs Meteor vs Meteorite
Asteroid - a small rocky body orbiting the sun
Meteoroid - a small rocky body orbiting the sun that enters the Earth's atmosphere
Meteor - a meteoroid that enters the Earth's atmosphere
Meteorite - a meteor that hits the Earth's surface

# Asteroid vs Comet
Comet - a small icy body orbiting the sun, has a tail when it gets close to the sun
