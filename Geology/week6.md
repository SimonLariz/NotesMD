## Week 6 

Accretionary Phase - solid material accretes to form planetesimals and protoplanets.

Internal Warming - heat from accretion and radioactive decay melts the interior of the planet.

Earth Solar System
1. More radioactive
2. More asteroids

Our Moon
We have a large moon, which is unusual for a planet our size.  It is thought that a Mars-sized object collided with the Earth and the debris from the collision formed the Moon.

Moon rocks share the same oxygen isotope ratios as Earth rocks, so the Moon must have formed from the same material as the Earth.

Solar Wind - blast away lighter elements, This is why inner planets are rocky and outer planets are gaseous.

Inner Planets - rocky, metallic, and dense, Few moons

Outer Planets - gaseous, icy, and less dense, Many moons

Differentiation - the process by which gravity separates materials according to density.

The differentiation of the Earth into layers was caused by the melting of the interior.

Convection within the outer core combined with the rotation of the Earth generates the magnetic field.

Magnetic field protects us from solar wind and makes ir possible for Earth to retain an atmosphere.

During the Hadean some parts of the Earth would develop a thin, ephemeral crust made of kromatite ( Ultramafic magma ) 

Carbonaceous chondrites - meteorites that contain water and organic compounds.

The Earth's atmosphere was formed by outgassing from volcanoes.

Unlike Earth, mars has no magnetic field, so the solar wind has stripped away most of its atmosphere

Ancient Mars had liquid water on its surface and a thicker atmosphere.
