## Week 8 

Acasta Gnesis - Oldest rock on Earth, 4.03 billion years old.

NGB ( Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt ) - Between 3.8 and 4.4 billion years old.

Jack Hills - Oldest mineral on Earth, 4.4 billion years old.

Late Heavy Bombardment - 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago, the moon was formed.

Early Archean - 3.8 to 3.0 billion years ago, sun was dimmer, Earth was cooler, Global climate was warmer because of thick atmosphere of CO2 and methane.

CHONPS - Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Sulfur (Elements made through stellar nucleosynthesis)

Six elements make up of 98% of all living things.

Pesudofossils - Non-biological objects that look like fossils.

Stromatolites - Oldest fossils, 3.5 billion years old, Bacterial mats that trap sediment, photosynthetic bacteria but no oxygen.

Anerobic life - Life that does not need oxygen.

Photosynthetic cyanobacteria - 2.7 billion years ago, oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere, Fe in the ocean oxidized

Oxygen interacts with methane to form CO2 and water vapor, CO2 is a greenhouse gas, so the Earth cooled.

Banded Iron Formations - 2.7 billion years ago, oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere, Fe in the ocean oxidized and precipitated out as banded iron formations.

Snowball Earth - 2.4 billion years ago, Earth was completely covered in ice

Hydrothermal activity - 2.4 billion years ago, Earth was completely covered in ice, hydrothermal activity kept the oceans from freezing.

Tillites -Earth was completely covered in ice, tillites are sedimentary rocks formed by glaciers.

Varves - Layers of sediment deposited in a lake, one layer for each year.

Paleoprotozoic - 2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago, oxygen levels increased, ozone layer formed, snowball earth ended, first eukaryotes, first multicellular organisms.
