## Week 3

Anaximander - believed humans evolved from fish

Empedocles - thought that many random creatures were created and the ones which were not well suited died out

Plato - prompted "Essentialism" - the idea that every object has a true form
    Species were created and were unchanging

Jean-Baptiste Lamarck - believed that species evolved through use and disuse of body parts and the inheritance of acquired characteristics
    Lamarckian evolution - the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring

Evolution - change over time

Darwin - believed that species evolved through natural selection, influenced by Lyell (deep time), Lamarck (lamarckism), and Malthus
    Natural selection - the process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring

Darwin's Observations:
1. Struggle - populations tend to increase unless checked by limiting factors
2. Variation - individuals in a population vary in their traits
3. Inheritance - many traits are heritable
4. Selection - individuals with certain heritable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce
    Artificial selection - the selective breeding of domesticated plants and animals to promote the occurrence of desirable traits in offspring
    Natural selection - the process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring

Alfred Russel Wallace - came up with the same theory as Darwin, corresponded with Darwin

Evidence for Evolution:
1. Homologous Structures - structures in different species that are similar because of common ancestry
2. Vestigial Structures - remnants of features that served important functions in the organism's ancestors
3. Fossil Record - the ordered sequence of fossils as they appear in the rock layers, marking the passage of geologic time
4. Biogeography - the scientific study of the geographic distributions of species
5. Molecular Biology - the study of the molecular basis of genes and gene expression; molecular genetics
