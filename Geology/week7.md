# Plate Tectonics

Earth has three main layers
- Crust
- Mantle
- Core

Lithosphere is the crust and upper mantle. It is broken into tectonic plates.

Asthenosphere is the upper mantle. It is a plastic solid.

Continental crust is thicker and less dense than oceanic crust.

Oceanic crust is thinner and more dense than continental crust.

Three types of plate boundaries
- Divergent, plates move apart
- Convergent, plates move together
- Transform, plates slide past each other

Divergent boundaries can form mid-ocean ridges or rift valleys.
Continental rifts can form new oceans.

When plates start to break apart they create a triple junction. 
But eventually one of the boundaries will close and the other two will become a divergent boundary. (Afar triple junction)

Convergent boundaries can form subduction zones or mountains.
Stacking - major mountain ranges are formed by the collision of two continents.

Normal faults are caused by tensional stress.
Reverse faults are caused by compressional stress.

Thrust faults are reverse faults with a dip angle of less than 45 degrees.

Craton - Old and stable parts of continental lithosphere, formed early in Earth's history.

Craton can be divided into two parts
- Shield, exposed craton, oldest most stable part
- Platform, covered craton, ancient rocks covered by sedimentary rocks

To make continental crust, volcanism at convergent boundaries is needed, create volcanic island arcs.

Accretion of Exotic Terranes - Pieces of crust that are added to a continent. Terrane is a piece of crust that has a geologic history distinct from the rest of the continent.

Mafic - Dark colored, high density, rich in iron and magnesium (Basalt), More silicon and oxygen

Felsic - Light colored, low density, rich in silica (Granite), Less silicon and oxygen

At depth, rocks are more coarse grained and have more mafic composition.

Fine grained rocks are extrusive or volcanic, coarse grained rocks are intrusive or plutonic.

Ultra-mafic rocks are very dark colored and have very high density. ( komatiite and peridotite )

Felsic rocks melt at lower temperatures than mafic rocks.

Partial melting - When a rock melts, it does not melt all at once. The minerals with the lowest melting point melt first.
