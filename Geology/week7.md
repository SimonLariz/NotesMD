# Plate Tectonics

Earth has three main layers
- Crust
- Mantle
- Core

Lithosphere is the crust and upper mantle. It is broken into tectonic plates.

Asthenosphere is the upper mantle. It is a plastic solid.

Continental crust is thicker and less dense than oceanic crust.

Oceanic crust is thinner and more dense than continental crust.

Three types of plate boundaries
- Divergent, plates move apart
- Convergent, plates move together
- Transform, plates slide past each other

Divergent boundaries can form mid-ocean ridges or rift valleys.
Continental rifts can form new oceans.

When plates start to break apart they create a triple junction. 
But eventually one of the boundaries will close and the other two will become a divergent boundary. (Afar triple junction)

Convergent boundaries can form subduction zones or mountains.
Stacking - major mountain ranges are formed by the collision of two continents.

Normal faults are caused by tensional stress.
Reverse faults are caused by compressional stress.

Thrust faults are reverse faults with a dip angle of less than 45 degrees.
