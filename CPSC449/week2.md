## Week 2 

# Test Driven Development
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.

# Loose Coupling
Loose coupling is a design goal that seeks to reduce the inter-dependencies between components of a system with the goal of reducing the risk that changes in one component will require changes in any other component. Loose coupling is often associated with the design and architecture of large software systems.

Reduce the risk dependencies between components of a system.

# Coding to Contract 
Coding to Contract - primarily about decoupling clients from providers. By creating explicit contracts, you extract the things that clients are allowed to see and depend on 

Dictates how pieces of software is used and how they interact with each other.

# Single Responsibility
The single responsibility principle is a computer programming principle that states that every module, class, or function should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class, module or function. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.

# Open/Closed Principle
The open/closed principle is the second of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states that "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can allow its behavior to be extended without modifying its source code.

# Inversion of Control
Inversion of control (IoC) is a programming principle. It is used to decouple classes and components. It moves the control of the object from the application to a container. This container then controls the creation and destruction of objects and also defines the scope of the object.

# Data Partitioning
Data partitioning is the process of dividing a large database into smaller, more manageable parts. By breaking the database into smaller pieces, it is easier to manage and maintain. Data partitioning is also known as database partitioning.
