Hiearchical Addressing - Allows efficent advertisement of routing information
 
 Works by dividing the IP address into two parts: network and host, where the network part is the same for all hosts in the same network.
 Advertisement of routing information is done by advertising the network part of the IP address. This is done by using CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation. 

NAT - Network Address Translation

NAT Translates IP addresses from one address space to another. This is done by using a NAT router. The NAT router has two interfaces, one for each address space. The NAT router translates the IP address of the sender to the IP address of the NAT router and vice versa.
