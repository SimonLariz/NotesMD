The Panopticon - Circular prison with a central guard tower, unseen by prisoners, who are never sure if they are being watched

Cheaper to record, analyze, and store data than ever before

Biometrics - the measurement and analysis of unique physical or behavioral characteristics (fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, etc.)
Difficult to change biometrics - once compromised, you can't change it

Algorithmic Surveillance - the use of computer algorithms to monitor behavior, activities, or information for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting people

We use these algorithms without knowing how they work

Predictive Policing - the use of mathematical, predictive analytics, and other analytical techniques in law enforcement to identify potential criminal activity
