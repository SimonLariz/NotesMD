## Infrastructure

Robert Moses - "Master Builder" of New York City, "The Architect of New York"

Infrastructure - the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise

Infrastructures are NOT neutral - they are designed to serve certain purposes and not others
    Reflect the values of the people who design them
    Hide in plain sight - we don't notice them until they break
    Hard to change - they are expensive and time consuming to change

Infrastructure is relational - it is a relationship between people and technology
    Ex: A road is useless without cars and drivers
    Ex: A car is useless without roads and drivers

Infrastructure is perspectival - it is seen differently by different people
    Ex: A road is a way to get to work for some, but a place to sleep for others

Infra - below, beneath, under
    Ex: Infrared - below red
    Ex: Infrastructure - below structure

Infrastructure is transparent in use
    Ex: Once you learn how to use one instance of an infrastructure, you can use any instance of that infrastructure

Infrastructure has a reach or scope beyond a single instance
    Infrastructures connect things

Infrastructure is learned as part of a membership
    Infrastructures are more visible to outsiders than insiders

Infrastructure is the embodiment of Standards

Infrastructures are built on other infrastructures
    Ex: A road is built on a path

Infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks
    Ex: WiFi is invisible until it stops working
    A good way to evaluate an infrastructure is to break it

Infrastructure is fixed in modular, not revolutionary, increments
    Infrastructure is big
    You have to adjust your plans to fit the infrastructure, not the other way around

When is a system an infrastructure?
    When it is used by many people
    When it is used for many purposes
    When it is used for a long time

Actor Network Theory - a theory that sees the world as a network of human and non-human actors
    Actors are entities that do things
    Networks are the relationships between actors
    Actors and networks are inseparable
    Treats all actors as equal

Anthropomorphism - treating non-humans like humans

Technomorphism - treating humans like non-humans
