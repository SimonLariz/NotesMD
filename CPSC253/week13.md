## Week 13

## Symmetric Encryption and Message Confidentiality 
## Public-Key Cryptography and Message Authentication

## Cryptographic Algorithms
- **Symmetric Encryption**: DES, 3DES, AES
- **Public-Key Cryptography**: RSA, DSA, ECC

## Hash Algorithms
- **Hash Algorithms**: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256
    - Used for integrity and authentication
    - Hash algorithms are used to create a fixed-size hash value from variable-size input
    - Hashes are often posted on websites to verify the integrity of the file

## Asymmetric Encryption
- **Public-Key Cryptography**: RSA, DSA, ECC
    - Plaintext is send to the receiver using the receiver's public [key]

    Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
    - Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures

## Synmetric Encryption
- **Symmetric Encryption**: DES, 3DES, AES
    - Conventional encryption, shared key or single key

## Block vs Stream Ciphers
- **Block Cipher**: Encrypts data in blocks
- **Stream Cipher**: Encrypts data in streams

## Attacks on Encryption
- **Brute Force Attack**: Trying all possible keys
- **Known Plaintext Attack**: Attacker has access to plaintext and ciphertext
- **Chosen Plaintext Attack**: Attacker can choose plaintext and obtain ciphertext
