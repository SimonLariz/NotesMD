# Week 9

## Risk Context (Cybersecurity)
- Risk is the potential for loss, damage, or destruction of an asset as a result of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

## Risk Level Determination and Meaning 
- Risk level is determined by the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the impact of the threat exploiting the vulnerability.

- Extreme Risk: The threat exploiting the vulnerability is highly likely and the impact of the threat exploiting the vulnerability is catastrophic.
- High Risk: The threat exploiting the vulnerability is likely and the impact of the threat exploiting the vulnerability is severe.
- Moderate Risk: The threat exploiting the vulnerability is somewhat likely and the impact of the threat exploiting the vulnerability is moderate.
- Low Risk: The threat exploiting the vulnerability is unlikely and the impact of the threat exploiting the vulnerability is minor.

## SCADA Systems
- SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems are used to control and monitor industrial processes. SCADA systems are used in a variety of industries including energy, water, and manufacturing.

## IT Security Management Controls
- IT security management controls are used to manage and mitigate risk. IT security management controls include administrative, technical, and physical controls.

## Control Classes 
- Supportive Controls: Supportive controls are used to support the implementation of other controls.
- Preventative Controls: Preventative controls are used to prevent a threat from exploiting a vulnerability.
- Detective Controls: Detective controls are used to detect a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

## Implementation of Plan
- The implementation of a plan is the process of putting a plan into action. The implementation of a plan includes the execution of the plan and the monitoring of the plan.

## Security Plan Policy
- A security plan policy is a policy that outlines the security plan for an organization. A security plan policy includes the identification of assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and controls.

## Implementation Follow-Up
- Implementation follow-up is the process of following up on the implementation of a plan. Implementation follow-up includes the review of the implementation of the plan and the identification of any issues or concerns.

Security Management is cyclic process
- Constantly review and update security plan

Evaluate changes for security impact
- Otherwise increase change of security breach
