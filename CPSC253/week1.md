# CIA Triad
- Confidentiality
    * Prevent unauthorized disclosure of information (privacy)
- Integrity
    * Prevent unauthorized modification of information (accuracy)
- Availability
    * Prevent unauthorized withholding of information (accessibility)

# Levels of Impact

- High

# Passive vs Active Attacks
- Passive
    * Eavesdropping
    * Traffic analysis

- Active
    * Masquerade
    * Replay
    * Modification of messages
    * Denial of service

# Attack Surfaces
- Attack surface
    * The set of ways in which an adversary can enter a system and potentially cause damage
    EX: Open ports, Services, SQL injection, etc. 

# FUndamental Security Design Principles
- Economy of mechanism
    * Keep the design as simple and small as possible
- Fail-safe defaults   
    * Default deny
- Complete mediation
    * Every access to every object must be checked for authority
- Open design
    * The design should not be secret
- Separation of privilege
    * Multiple conditions must be met to access an object
