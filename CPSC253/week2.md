## Week 2

# Attack Trees
Attack tree - branching, hierarchical diagram that represents a set of potential techniques for exploiting security vulnerabilities. The root node represents the initial attack, and the leaves represent the possible outcomes of the attack. The attack tree is used to systematically evaluate the security of a system, and to identify the possible ways in which an attacker can exploit the system.

# Cryptography
Cryptography - the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties. Cryptography is used to secure communication and protect information from unauthorized access.

* Scrambling of information to make it unreadable
* Transforming information into secure form

# Cryptographic Algorithms
* Symmetric Encryption Algorithms
* Hashing Algorithms
* Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms

# Symmetric Encryption Algorithms
Symmetric encryption algorithm - a cryptographic algorithm that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. The key is shared between the sender and the receiver.

EXAMPLES: DES, Triple DES, AES

* Stream Ciphers - encrypts one bit at a time
* Block Ciphers - encrypts a block of data at a time

# Hashing Algorithms
Hashing algorithm - a cryptographic algorithm that takes an input and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number. The output is called a hash value or hash code.

EXAMPLES: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256

# Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms
Asymmetric encryption algorithm - a cryptographic algorithm that uses two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption.

EXAMPLES: RSA, DSS, ECC

# Digital Signatures
Digital signature - a cryptographic technique that is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message. A digital signature is created using the private key of the sender, and it can be verified using the public key of the sender.

# Certificate Authorities
Certificate authority - an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate is a digital document that is used to verify the identity of a person, organization, or website.

# User authentication
User authentication - the process of verifying the identity of a user. User authentication is used to control access to a system or application, and to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

# Four factors of authentication:
* Something you know (e.g., password)
* Something you have (e.g., smart card)
* Something you are (e.g., fingerprint)
* Something you do (e.g., typing pattern)

# Multi-factor authentication
Multi-factor authentication - a security process that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity for a login or other transaction.

# Assurance Level
Assurance level - a measure of the confidence that can be placed in the security of a system or application. The assurance level is based on the strength of the security controls that are in place, and the level of confidence that can be placed in the security of the system or application.

* Level 1: No confidence
* Level 2: Some confidence
* Level 3: High confidence
* Level 4: Very high confidence

Potential Impact - the potential impact of a security breach on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

* Low - an authentication error could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on an organization's operations, assets, or individuals.
* Moderate - an authentication error could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on an organization's operations, assets, or individuals.
* High - an authentication error could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on an organization's operations, assets, or individuals.

# Password-based Authentication
Password-based authentication - a method of user authentication that requires the user to enter a password. The password is used to verify the identity of the user, and to control access to a system or application.

Widely used because it is easy to implement and use, and it is cost-effective.
